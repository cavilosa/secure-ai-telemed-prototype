## üéØ Project Vision

In an era of rapidly advancing AI, handling sensitive data‚Äîespecially Protected Health Information (PHI)‚Äîrequires more than just functional code. This project serves as a practical, hands-on exploration of building a secure and resilient system from the ground up.

The goal is not just to build a telemedicine app, but to answer the question: **"How can we leverage AI features while systematically managing the unique risks they introduce?"**

This repository documents the entire lifecycle of securing a modern web application, from initial design and defensive AI implementation to adversarial stress-testing, automated MLOps pipelines, and finally, a full compliance-focused security audit. It is built with a cross-border compliance mindset, considering the principles of both the **US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** and **Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Secure Messaging Module:** A chat system for patients and healthcare navigators.

* **AI-Powered PII/PHI Redaction:** An NLP-based filter that uses **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to automatically detect and tokenize sensitive information in real-time before it's stored.

* **Reversible Masking (Tokenization):** Sensitive data is vaulted and replaced with non-sensitive tokens. The original data is only ever reconstructed in-memory for authorized, authenticated users.

* **JWT-Based Authentication:** Secure, stateless user authentication managed via Auth0.

* **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:** An automated pipeline using GitHub Actions to test code, scan for vulnerabilities, and run adversarial attacks on the AI model before deployment.

* **Structured Logging & Monitoring:** Detailed, structured (JSON) logs for security events, especially for authentication attempts and access to sensitive data.

## üîê Security Focus

This project is built around a four-phase security implementation plan:

1. **Phase 1: Defensive AI & Secure Foundations:** Building the initial application with security controls and a defensive AI-powered PII filter at its core.

2. **Phase 2: Adversarial Mindset & Red Teaming:** Developing a custom **Prompt Injection Fuzzer** to actively attack and identify weaknesses in the AI filter.

3. **Phase 3: Secure MLOps & Automation:** Creating a CI/CD pipeline that automates security testing, ensuring vulnerabilities are caught before they reach production.

4. **Phase 4: Full-Stack Audit & Compliance:** Conducting a comprehensive security audit of the entire application and producing a professional report mapping controls to HIPAA and PIPEDA principles.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is designed with a core principle of data separation. The main application database stores only tokenized, non-sensitive information, while a separate, highly-secured "vault" stores the actual PII/PHI. Access to this vault is strictly controlled and heavily audited.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3.11+, Flask

* **AI/ML:** spaCy (for Named Entity Recognition), Scikit-learn

* **Database:** Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL), SQLite (development)

* **Authentication:** Auth0, PyJWT

* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

* **Cloud Platform:** Heroku (Application Hosting), AWS S3 (File Storage)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+

* Pip & Virtualenv

* Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/cavilosa/secure-ai-telemed-prototype.git](https://github.com/cavilosa/secure-ai-telemed-prototype.git)
   cd secure-ai-telemed-prototype
   
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```
   # For macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # For Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   ```

4. **Download the NLP model:**

   ```
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   
   ```

5. **Run the application:**

   ```
   flask run
   
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
   

## üß™ Testing

This project uses `pytest` for unit and integration testing. All tests are located in the `tests/` directory.

The initial test suite in `tests/test_reduction.py` covers the PII/PHI redaction logic, ensuring that emails and phone numbers are correctly identified and redacted while invalid formats are ignored.

### Running Tests

1.  Make sure you have installed all project dependencies, including `pytest`.
2.  From the project's root directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    or
    ```
    python -m pytest
    ```

This will automatically discover and run all test files within the `tests/` directory.

## üß† Advanced Ideas & Future Scope

This project serves as a foundation. Here are some advanced concepts that could be explored in the future:

* **Fine-Tuning the NER Model:** Fine-tune a transformer model (like BERT) on custom, domain-specific medical data to create a PII filter with much higher accuracy and the ability to detect custom entity types (e.g., `MEDICAL_CONDITION`, `DRUG_NAME`).

* **Differential Privacy:** Implement techniques that allow for statistical analysis of the chat data without exposing individual user information.

* **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA):** Evolve the infrastructure so that no user or service is trusted by default, requiring strict verification for every request.

* **Homomorphic Encryption:** Explore the possibility of performing computations directly on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.

* **Automated Compliance Checks:** Build scripts into the CI/CD pipeline that automatically check infrastructure and code against a subset of HIPAA/PIPEDA technical requirements.
