'''That's the perfect question, and it leads directly to the next crucial step in the plan. You've just built the ticket booth; now you need to build the ticket taker.

Returning the JWT to the front-end is the entire goal of the `/login` endpoint. Think of that token as a temporary, secure key card. The user proves who they are *once* with their password, and in return, you give them this key card that they can use to access protected areas for the next hour.

### What's Next: Using the Token to Create Protected Routes

The next step is to make that token *useful*. You will create API endpoints that are only accessible to users who present a valid token. This is the core of API security.

Here's the two-part process:

**1. The Front-End's Responsibility (Conceptual)**

  * **Store the Token:** After a successful login, the front-end (your Jinja2 template, or a future JavaScript app) would immediately save the JWT it received.
  * **Send the Token:** For every subsequent request to a protected part of your API (like fetching patient data), the front-end must include the token in a special request header called `Authorization`. The standard format is `Bearer <token>`.

**2. The Back-End's Responsibility (Your Next Coding Task)**

This is where you'll write new code. You will create **protected routes**. These are endpoints that:

1.  Check for the `Authorization` header in the incoming request.
2.  Extract the JWT from the header.
3.  **Verify the token's signature** using your `SECRET_KEY` to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
4.  Check that the token has not expired.
5.  If the token is valid, the code extracts the `user_id` from the token's payload and allows the request to proceed.
6.  If the token is missing, invalid, or expired, it immediately rejects the request with a `401 Unauthorized` error.

### Your Next Step in the Roadmap

Looking at your plan, this is exactly what's scheduled for next week:

  * **Day 9 â€” Monday, Sept 15:** *Core Project (Protected Routes): Implement a decorator in Flask to protect API endpoints, requiring a valid JWT for access.*

You will create a Python **decorator** (e.g., `@token_required`) that contains all the token-checking logic. You can then apply this decorator to any route you want to protect, making your code clean, secure, and reusable.

**Example of what's next:**

```python
# You will create this decorator
def token_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        # ... logic to check for and validate the token ...
        # ... if valid, get user_id and pass it to the route ...
        return f(current_user, *args, **kwargs)
    return decorated


# Then you will use it like this:
@app.route('/patients', methods=['GET'])
@token_required  # <-- This protects the route
def get_all_patients(current_user):
    # This code will only run if the user provides a valid token.
    # 'current_user' would be the user object you looked up from the token.
    return jsonify({"message": f"Welcome user {current_user.username}! Here is the patient data."})
```

You've successfully built the gate. Next week, you'll build the lock and give your users the key.'''
